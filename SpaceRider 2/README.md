# SpaceRider 2

Versions 2.0.1 to 2.2 requires "Activating". Use the "Bypass Activation" for that, or look into the `.fla` file for activation code :)

Changelog:

- 2.2.3
  
  Fixed update checking "Failed to connect" by changing online source.  
  Now the update check fully works.
  
  Removed "Activation" and scrapped built-in "activation codes"
  
- 2.2.2
  
  Fixed an old bug where information would not fade out.
  
  Possibly some balance tweaks.
  
- 2.2
  
  New release: Older changelogs are lost
